# Contributing to `cargo-screeps` and `screeps-game-api`:

1. Ask questions. We're all in on the `#rust-wasm` channel on the [screeps slack].
2. Make PRs early, often. We'll review code thoroughly and help where possible.
3. Issues are your guide for what needs to be done. If you think something needs doing and it isn't
   already an issue, make it one!
